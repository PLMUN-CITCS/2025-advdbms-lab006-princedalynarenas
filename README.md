## **Instructions**

### **Step 1.1: Accept the Assignment**

   1. Click on the assignment link provided by your instructor.
   2. GitHub Classroom will create a **private repository** under your GitHub account.
   3. After the repository is created, click **"Go to Repository"** to view your assignment.

---

### **Step 1.2: Setup your Git Environment**
Only perform this if this is the first time you will setup your Git Environment

   1. Create a GitHub Account:
   ```bash
   https://github.com/signup?source=login
   ```
      
   2. Download and Install Git on your Laptop/Desktop:
   ```bash
   https://git-scm.com/downloads
   ```
   
   3. Create a Folder in your Laptop/Desktop
   4. Right-click anywhere in the created folder and select "Open Git Bash Here".
   5. In the Git Bash Terminal, set your git name, perform command:
   ```bash
   git config --global user.name "Your Name"
   ```
   
   6. In the Git Bash Terminal, set your git email, perform command:
   ```bash
   git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
   ```
   
   7. Create your SSH Key, just follow the instructions, no need to provide filename and passphrase. In the Git Bash Terminal, perform command:
   ```bash
   ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"
   ```
   
   8. Copy your SSH Keys into clipboard. In the Git Bash Terminal, perform command:
   ```bash
   clip < ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
   ```
   
   9. Log in to your GitHub account.
   10. In the upper-right corner of GitHub, click your profile picture and select Settings.
   11. In the left sidebar, click on SSH and GPG keys.
   12. Click the New SSH key button.
   13. In the Title field, give the key a recognizable name (e.g., "My Windows Laptop").
   14. In the Key field, CTRL + V or paste the keys copied into your clipboard. Save the key.
   15. Go Back to terminal, use command:
   ```bash
   ssh -T git@github.com
   ```

### **Step 2: Clone the Repository to Your Local Machine**

   1. On your repository page, click the green **"Code"** button.
   2. Copy the repository URL (choose HTTPS for simplicity).
   3. Open your terminal (or Git Bash, Command Prompt, or PowerShell) and run:
   
   ```bash
   git clone <git_repo_url>
   ```
   
   4. Navigate into the cloned folder:
   
   ```bash
   cd <git_cloned_folder>
   ```

### **Step 3: Complete the Assignment**

**Exercise # 04 - Guided Coding Exercise: Creating Tables with Primary and Foreign Keys**

   **Objective:**
   Learn how to create tables with primary and foreign key relationships in SQL. This exercise demonstrates how to link two tables together, ensuring referential integrity.

   **Folder Structure:**
   ```
   university_db/
   ├── create_courses_table.sql
   └── create_enrollments_table.sql
   ```

   **File Naming Convention:**
   - `create_courses_table.sql`: Contains the SQL statement for creating the Courses table.
   - `create_enrollments_table.sql`: Contains the SQL statement for creating the Enrollments table with foreign key constraints.

   **Notable Observations (to be discussed after completing the exercise):**
   - Referential Integrity: Foreign keys enforce referential integrity. This means that you cannot insert a record into the `Enrollments` table with a `StudentID` or `CourseID` that does not exist in the `Students` or `Courses` tables, respectively. This helps prevent data inconsistencies.
   Order of Table Creation: The order in which you create tables with foreign key relationships is crucial. The referenced tables (parent tables) must exist before the referencing table (child table).
   - Data Types: The data types of the foreign key columns (`StudentID` and `CourseID` in Enrollments) must match the data types of the corresponding primary key columns in the `Students` and `Courses` tables.
   - Composite Keys: You could also have a composite key in the `Enrollments` table, for example, `(StudentID, CourseID)` to prevent a student from enrolling in the same course multiple times. You would then make that combination `UNIQUE` or `PRIMARY KEY`.
   - Foreign Key Constraints: Explore different foreign key constraint options, such as `ON DELETE CASCADE` or `ON DELETE SET NULL`, which control what happens when a record in the parent table is deleted.
   - Database Design: This exercise demonstrates a fundamental database design principle. Proper use of primary and foreign keys is essential for creating relational databases.
   - ER Diagrams: Entity-relationship (ER) diagrams are a useful tool for visualizing the relationships between tables in a database.
      
   **Step-by-Step Instructions:**

   1. Setting up the Environment
      - Ensure you have a SQL database management system installed and that you've connected to the `UniversityDB` database (created in Problem 1) and created the `Students` table (created in Problem 2). The `Students` table will be referenced by a foreign key in this exercise.
      - Create the two SQL files as shown in the folder structure above within the `university_db` directory.
      
   2. `create_courses_table.sql` (Create Courses Table):
      - Open `create_courses_table`.sql in a text editor.
      - Create the Courses table:
      ```SQL
      USE `UniversityDB`;

      -- Step 1: Create the Courses table
      CREATE TABLE `Courses` (
      `CourseID` INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT, -- Or SERIAL/IDENTITY as needed for your DBMS
      `CourseName` VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL
      );

      ```
      
      - Important Note: Use `AUTO_INCREMENT` (MySQL), `SERIAL` (PostgreSQL), or `IDENTITY` (SQL Server) for the `CourseID` as appropriate for your database system.

      - Save the `create_courses_table.sql` file.
      
   3. `create_enrollments_table.sql` (Create Enrollments Table):
      - Open `create_enrollments_table.sql` in a text editor.
      - Create the `Enrollments` table with foreign key constraints:
      ```SQL
      USE `UniversityDB`;

      -- Step 2: Create the Enrollments table with foreign key constraints
      CREATE TABLE `Enrollments` (
      `EnrollmentID` INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT, -- Or SERIAL/IDENTITY
      `StudentID` INT,
      `CourseID` INT,
      `EnrollmentDate` DATE,
      CONSTRAINT `fk_student` FOREIGN KEY (`StudentID`) REFERENCES `Students`(`StudentID`),
      CONSTRAINT `fk_course` FOREIGN KEY (`CourseID`) REFERENCES `Courses`(`CourseID`)
      );

      ```
         - Important Note: The order in which you create the tables is important. You must create the `Courses` and `Students` tables before you create the `Enrollments` table because the `Enrollments` table references them via foreign keys.
         - The `fk_student` and `fk_course` are names given to the foreign key constraints. You can choose descriptive names.
         - The `REFERENCES Students(StudentID)` and `REFERENCES Courses(CourseID)` clauses specify the tables and columns that the foreign keys reference.
      
      - Save the `create_enrollments_table.sql` file.

   4. Executing the SQL Scripts:
   - Open your SQL client and connect to the `UniversityDB` database.
   - Create Courses Table: Execute the `create_courses_table.sql` script.
   - Create Enrollments Table: Execute the `create_enrollments_table.sql` script.

### **Step 4: Push Changes to GitHub**
Once you've completed your changes, follow these steps to upload your work to your GitHub repository.

1. Check the status of your changes:
   Open the terminal and run:
   
   ```bash
   git status
   ```
   This command shows any modified or new files.
   
2. Stage the changes:
   Add all modified files to staging:
   
   ```bash
   git add .
   ```
   
3. Commit your changes:
   Write a meaningful commit message:
   
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Submitting ADVDBMS Week 02 - Session 01 - Exercise 04"
   ```
   
4. Push your changes to GitHub:
   Upload your changes to your remote repository:
   
   ```bash
   git push origin main
   ```
